// You’re working on an art marketplace app 
// that lets the user submit multiple orders for an art 
// item at the same time. Each time the user presses the 
// “Buy” button, the “Pending” 
// counter should increase by one. After three seconds,
//  the “Pending” counter should decrease, and the “Completed”
//   counter should increase.

// However, the “Pending” counter does not behave as 
// intended. When you press “Buy”, it decreases to -1 
// (which should not be possible!). And if you click
//  fast twice, both counters seem to behave unpredictably.

//to resolve the task, use batching updater functions
